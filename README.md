## Project Description

Mini Project 5 is about working with text. In this project we are taking text picese and articels and extreact, clean and transform the data so it can be used for vectorization. The goal is to have a streamlit application where users can input a text and get the top 3 most related articles from the dataset based on the user input.

## Questions

- Suggest various implementations of such an application:

  - Input based on user input, the application should return the top 3 most related articles from the dataset. Here can we have a dataset with articles that has been vectorized and then we can use cosine similarity to find the most related articles based on the user input.

  - Text input where the user can input a text and get the top 3 most related articles from the dataset based on the user input.
    Here can we have a dataset with articles/or other texts that has been vectorized and then we can use cosine similarity to find the most related articles based on the user input.
